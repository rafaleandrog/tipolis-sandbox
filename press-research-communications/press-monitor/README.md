# Tipolis Press Monitor

Weekly news pipeline for special economic zones, free zones, charter cities,
and Tipolis priority countries. The Google Sheet is the backend; the Apps
Script Web App is the API; this folder is the only interface the editor uses.

```

The frontend is plain HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no framework. It inherits
the canonical Tipolis design system (`docs/ui/TIPOLIS_UI_SPEC.md`) and uses
the `press-research-communications` page accent (gold / `--accent-digital`).

## Owner setup

Follow `../docs/tipolis_build_guide.md` for the full step-by-step including
the Google Sheet, the AI Studio key, and the Drive folder. The short version:

1. **Create the Sheet** and open Apps Script bound to it.
2. **Paste the 11 `.gs` files** from `../apps-script/` and `appsscript.json`.
   (Easier path: install `clasp` and use the workflow below.)
3. Run the menu item **Tipolis → Create / repair project sheets** once.
4. Open the `report_settings` sheet and fill the empty values:
   - `gemini_api_key`
   - `gnews_api_key` (optional — fallback only)
   - `report_drive_folder_id`
   - `report_template_doc_id`
   - `frontend_bearer_token` (any random 32+ char string)
5. Run **Install all triggers** from the menu (06:00 daily search, Mon 07:00
   weekly AI filter).
6. **Deploy → New deployment → Web app** (execute as you, anyone access).
   Copy the `/exec` URL.
7. Open `assets/js/config.js` and paste both the URL and the bearer token.
8. **GitHub Pages**: serve from the `main` branch root (the existing setting).
   The frontend lives at:
   `https://<user>.github.io/tipolis-sandbox/press-research-communications/press-monitor/`

The five screens are now wired. No further frontend configuration is needed.

## Backend sync (GitHub → Apps Script)

The `.gs` files in this repo do not execute by themselves — Apps Script
runs from its own project. A GitHub Actions workflow auto-syncs the two:
every commit to `main` that touches `apps-script/**` runs `clasp push`
on a GitHub runner, so the backend stays in lockstep with the repo. No
local install required.

The one-time setup (Apps Script API → credentials → GitHub Secret) is
documented in [`../apps-script/README.md`](../apps-script/README.md).

## Weekly Monday workflow

1. **Triage** — `triage.html`. Approve the items that go into the report.
   Each approval auto-triggers the AI bullet summary in the background.
2. **Summary** — `summary.html`. Walk through the approved items one by one.
   Trim each set of bullets to 3–5. Save & next persists per item.
3. **Report** — `report.html`. Drag-to-reorder inside the two sections,
   then **Generate report** to produce the Doc, then **Archive & reset week**
   when the Doc is ready.
4. **History** — `history.html`. Browse the archive at any time.

## What is NOT in this version

- No fully-manual article entry (deferred).
- No localStorage / sessionStorage anywhere — secrets sit only in
  `report_settings` (server-side) and `assets/js/config.js` (the bearer token
  and the Web App URL).
- No historical migration of past reports — that is a separate later task.
